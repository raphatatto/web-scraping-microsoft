Our mission is to build the data platform for the age of AI, powering a new class of data-first applications and driving a data culture. We are looking to hire Software Development Engineers to join our team. Within Azure Data, the databases team builds and maintains Microsoft's operational Database systems. We store and manage data in a structured way to enable a multitude of applications across various industries. Are you passionate about Database Technology and Cloud Computing and fascinated by challenges such as managing millions of databases across a wide price/performance spectrum?  The Azure SQL DB Resource Governance (RG) team is responsible for ensuring a high-quality experience for customers that provision databases that are allocated slices of a single core all the way up to an entire machine.  This wide range in potential resources provisioned (performance) translates to potential revenue that spans pennies to thousands of dollars per day.  Compounding this landscape is the variety of SQL DB offerings which include Serverless (aka pay-for-use). In the Serverless offering we eliminate the need for users to accurately the max size of the SQL container. They specify a theoretical maximum and we scale their resources up and down depending on workload’s demands and charge them for exactly what they use.
